This is an experimental feature and is not recommended for use in a production environment. For updates on the progress of the feature or if you want to leave feedback, see the associated [GitHub issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/10141).

While the OpenSearch Stats APIs offer insights into the inner workings of each node and an OpenSearch cluster as a whole, the statistics lack certain details, such as percentiles, and do not provide the semantics of richer metric types like histograms. Consequently, identifying outliers within cluster statistic becomes challenging when using only the Stats API. 

The OpenSearch Metric Framework plugin adds comprehensive metric support to effectively monitor an OpenSearch cluster. Using the Metrics Framework APIs, plugin and extension developers can add new monitoring metrics. In addition, the OpenSearch distribution bundles the `telemetry-otel` plugin which provides the implementation for metrics instrumentation based on the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) Java SDK.


## Getting started

The Metrics Framework feature is experimental as of OpenSearch 2.11. To begin using the metrics framework feature, you need to first enable the `telemetry feature` using the `opensearch.experimental.feature.telemetry.enabled` feature flag and subsequently using the metrics framework feature flag. 

Enabling this feature can consume system resources. Before enabling the Metrics Framework, consider if you have enough cluster resources to allocate.

### Enabling the feature flag on a node using tarball

The `enable` flag is toggled using a new Java Virtual Machine (JVM) parameter that is set either in `OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS` or in `config/jvm.options`.

#### Option 1: Enable the experimental feature flag in the `opensearch.yml` file

1. Change to the top directory of your OpenSearch installation:

```bash
cd \path\to\opensearch
```

2. Open your OpenSearch configuration folder, and then open the `opensearch.yml` file with a text editor.
3. Add the following line:

```bash
opensearch.experimental.feature.telemetry.enabled=true
```
{% include copy.html %}

4. Save your changes and close the file.

#### Option 2: Modify jvm.options

Add the following lines to `config/jvm.options` before starting the OpenSearch process to enable the feature and its dependency:

```bash
-Dopensearch.experimental.feature.telemetry.enabled=true
```
{% include copy.html %}

Run OpenSearch:

```bash
./bin/opensearch
```
{% include copy.html %}

#### Option 3: Enable from an environment variable

You can enable the Metrics Framework feature in a single command when you start OpenSearch or by setting an environment variable.

To add these flags inline when starting OpenSearch, run the following command:

```bash
OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS="-Dopensearch.experimental.feature.telemetry.enabled=true" ./opensearch-2.9.0/bin/opensearch
```
{% include copy.html %}

To define the environment variable separately, prior to running OpenSearch, run the following command:

```bash
export OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS="-Dopensearch.experimental.feature.telemetry.enabled=true"
 ./bin/opensearch
```
{% include copy.html %}

### Enable with Docker containers

If youâ€™re running Docker, add the following line to `docker-compose.yml` under `environment`:

```bash
OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS="-Dopensearch.experimental.feature.telemetry.enabled=true"
```
{% include copy.html %}


### Enable metrics framework

Once you've enabled the feature flag, you can enable the Metrics Framework by using the following setting that enables metrics in the opensearch.yaml:

```bash
telemetry.feature.metrics.enabled=true
```

The OpenSearch Metrics Framework supports various telemetry solutions through plugins. Use the following instructions to enable the `telemetry-otel` plugin:



1. **Publish Interval:** The Metrics Framework can locally aggregate the metrics with unique dimensions about the configured publish interval, and then export those metrics. By default, the interval is 1 minute. However, you be change the interval using the `telemetry.otel.metrics.publish.interval` cluster setting.
2. **Exporters:** Exporters are responsible for persisting the data. OpenTelemetry provides several out-of-the-box exporters. OpenSearch supports the following exporters:
    - `LoggingMetricExporter`: Exports metrics to a log file, generating a separate file in the logs directory `_otel_metrics.log`. Default is `telemetry.otel.metrics.exporter.class=io.opentelemetry.exporter.logging.LoggingMetricExporter`.
    - `OtlpGrpcMetricExporter`: Exports spans through gRPC. To use this exporter, you need to install the `otel-collector` on the node. By default, it writes to the http://localhost:4317/ endpoint. To use this exporter, set the following static setting: `telemetry.otel.metrics.exporter.class=io.opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.metrics.OtlpGrpcMetricExporter`.
